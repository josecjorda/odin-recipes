    <h2>Description: Onion burgers are one of America's greatest regional renditions, but be warned--these are diner style, and prepare for those drops of grease, but don't let it scare you. 
        They're so craveable, you may want to eat a second! You do not want to use anything under an 80/20 fat ratio. If you do, they won't be good.</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1 pound 85% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Hamburger Seasoning</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced portobello mushrooms</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>4 rolls rolls, hamburger, white, enriched, plain</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add butter and oil; heat until butter is melted. Add onion and garlic. Cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, divide ground meat into 4 portions and shape into patties. Season with salt and seasoning.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or flat-top over medium-high heat for a few minutes. Place patties into the hot skillet and smash with a spatula or bacon press. 
            Hold patties down for 30 seconds, then cover each patty with some of the cooked onion. Cook for 2 minutes. Carefully flip burgers, making sure to scrape the browned 
            bits off the skillet. </li>
        <li>Press down on the flipped patties to sink the onions into the meat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add sliced mushrooms to the skillet used for the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Season patties with salt and pepper and place a slice of cheese on each. Cook until burgers have reached the desired doneness, 2 to 4 minutes more. 
            Top each patty with leftover onion and mushrooms and serve on buns. 
        </li>
