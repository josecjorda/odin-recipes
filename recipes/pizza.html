    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices stale French or Italian bread (1/2-inch thick)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons soft unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup  finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>2/3 cup pizza sauce, or as needed</li>
        <li>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, diced</li> 
        <li>18 slices pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Spread butter generously on both sides of the bread slices and set them out on the prepared baking sheet. Freshly grate Parmigiano-Reggiono cheese on top of each bread slice, 
            preeing the cheese lightly into the butter so it sticks better. Turn bread slices over, so cheese side is down. Top with pizza sauce, making sure to spread it evenly on top of 
            the slices.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms start to turn golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes</li>
        <li>Top with mozzarella and 3 pepperoni slices each (or toppings of your choice). Bake until mozzarella has melted and bottom crust is crispy and well browned, 10 to 12 minutes more. </li>
    </ol>
