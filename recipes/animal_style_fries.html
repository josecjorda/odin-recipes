    <h1>Animal Style Fries</h1>

    <h2>Description: Everyone knows that despite being freshly cut, the pale and soggy fries are In-N-Out's weakest point, but if you smother them in cheese, sweet caramelized onions, 
        and In-N-Out spread, they're magical. So replacing the sad fries with crispy frozen fries really is an improvement over the originals here. Spread is just a basic sweet and tangy burger sauce with mayo, ketchup, relish, 
        a little sugar, and a little vinegar. The onions are really the stars here - soft, sweet, and jammy. Be sure to serve immediately as soon as the 
        fries are cooked - the residual heat of the fries and the onions is what melts the cheese. </h2>
